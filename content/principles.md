Oxide's principles of operation consist of our mission, our principles and our
values.  These are not mere corporate bromides; they comprise the emotional,
moral, ethical and spritual core of our company -- they are the soul of Oxide.
For more details on why we think it's important to be explicit about our
mission, our principles and our values (and why the distinctions between them
matter), please see the 2017 Monktoberfest talk on <a

Leadership</a>.

## Mission

Oxide's mission:

> Kick butt, have fun, don't cheat, love our customers, change computing forever

If this sounds familiar, it's because it's essentially Scott McNealy's coda for
Sun Microsystems.  But we use this mission not because it happens to have been
Sun's but because it is *ours*:  it is a concise expression of why we're here
and how we operate.  Taking it apart: 

- **Kick butt**:  We believe in working hard to deliver a kick-butt product,
experience and company.  We are by nature a competitive company, but we
compete by offering a better alternative, not by denigrating or otherwise
undercutting the competition.

- **Have fun**:  We believe that work is most fulfilling when it is fun -- and
that a good sense of humor is essential for humility in the good times and
endurance in the lean ones.

- **Don't cheat**:  We believe in playing by the rules of the game, abiding by
both their letter and their spirit.  If we don't like the rules, we work 
openly and collaboratively to improve them.

- **Love our customers**: We recognize that our customers take a risk on us,
and we love them for it.  We work to deliver products that they will love in turn
-- and if and when our products fall short, our love for our customers trumps
our own ego.  

- **Change computing forever**:  Computing is our shared passion; our calling
is to advance the state of the art, bringing those advances to the broadest
possible audience.

## Principles

Principles are fundamental, universal truths that transcend time, geography,
culture and context.  These principles are not aspirations, they are
constraints; we expect them to be known by all Oxide employees and adhered
to under all conditions.  

- **Integrity**.  Principles are meaningless without the integrity to uphold
them; we view our integrity as our single most important principle.
We do not sacrifice our principles for expediency or comfort.

- **Honesty**.  We seek and tell the truth, even where those truths are
painful or inconvenient.  We abide by the spirit of the truth, not merely
its letter; we do not hide falsehoods in language that is technically true
or otherwise misleading.

- **Decency**. We treat others with dignity, be they
colleague, customer, community or competitor.

## Values

Unlike principles, values indicate relative importance:  they are objectives
rather than constraints, and can come into tension with one another.
Moreover, values are not universal: while we would hope that every company
would share our principles, we know that not every company will share all of
our values.  That said, shared values are the bedrock of Oxide -- and we
do in fact expect all of our values to be strongly held by every employee.

To ensure these values are explicitly considered and internalized, we take an
unusual step: we ask Oxide employees to commit these values to memory before
their first day of employment.  To some this might seem outlandish or fusty,
but we
believe that it serves to emphasize our values -- and the act of
memorizing them affords new Oxide employees a chance to discuss them
with their spouse, partner, children, parents or friends.  
We encourage this
kitchen table discussion, as it lets our loved ones understand the
values at the core of the company we choose to build together.

In part to facilitate their memorization, and in part to make clear that 
there is no hierarchy or ordering among them, we present these values in
alphabetical order.

- **Candor**.  We believe in being forthright, even when that's difficult.
We do not shy from the truth merly because it is unpopular.

- **Courage**. We are bold, willing to do things even if they are
unconventional, difficult, scary, or otherwise unproven.

- **Curiosity**.  We are lifetime learners, unafraid of learning
something new -- be it an intimidating new technology,
a perplexing system behavior or a novel customer use case.

- **Diversity**.  We believe the best results come from combining different
perspectives and uniting them with shared values and mission.  We believe in
diversity on all axes.

- **Empathy**.

- **Humor**.

- **Optimism**.

- **Resilience**

- **Responsibility**.

- **Rigor**.

- **Teamwork**.

- **Thriftiness**.

- **Transparency**.

- **Urgency**.
