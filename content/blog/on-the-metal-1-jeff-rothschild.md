On this episode of On the Metal, we interview Jeff Rothschild. Jeff has had a 
fascinating journey solving all sorts of fun problems at various levels of the 
stack. He is most widely known as being a co-founder of Veritas Software and the first VP 
of Engineering at Facebook, but his story does not start there. Join us as we 
hear Jeff’s stories from his impressive technical endeavors including 
disassembling MS-DOS, editing machine code in an octal editor, trolling 
coworkers in error messages, the origin story of `ftruncate`, and more.
