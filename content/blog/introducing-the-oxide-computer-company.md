We have started a computer company!  If you haven't yet, read Jess's account
of us being <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/born-in-a-garage/">born
in a garage</a> and Bryan's on <a
href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/?p=1086">the soul of our new computer
company</a>.  Also, see the perspective of one of our founding engineers, <a
href="https://twitter.com/rmustacc">Robert Mustacchi</a>, on <a
href="xxx">joining Oxide</a>.

If it needs to be said, starting a computer company is an ambitious
endeavor; we are thrilled to have investment led by Eclipse Ventures and
joined by an incredible group of institutional and angel investors.  Our
investors see what we see:  the potential to integrate hardware and software
together to bring hyperscaler-class infrastructure to everyone.

To use the machine as metaphor, Oxide is at the earliest stages of boot: the
power is on, and the first instructions have been executed -- but we have a
long way to go before we're fully operational! If you are interested in
