Welp, that's a wrap for the first season of the On the Metal podcast. Join us
as we reminisce about some of our favorite parts (although it was very hard to
choose). We also uncover some aspects of the podcast you never heard about!
While this is the end of the first season, we absolutely cannot wait for the
second season. Thank you so much for listening, we will be back soon!
