We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut 
codeâ€”software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor 
the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software 
design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their 
work available as open source. 

We're seeking engineers who are able to move up 
and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty 
device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, 
instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, 
or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be 
understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same 
problem. 

We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, 
tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. 
And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest 
can outweigh experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to 
step up.
