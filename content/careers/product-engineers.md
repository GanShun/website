We are looking for engineers and designers with a sharp attention to detail,
who love building products that delight operators and developers. This is an
opportunity to design and implement a new interface for developing cloud-like
applications with a great team. We're seeking highly motivated folks that
understand the application deployment process from the viewpoint of both the
developer and operator.

This job will require taking complex ideas and making them simple for a user to
understand and use intuitively. We love folks with a passion for making the
impossible possible. We will be working directly with customers to provide
solutions for their needs. You will be working primarily on the user facing
interfaces such as the API and user-interface.

We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, 
tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. 
And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest 
can trump experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to 
step up.
