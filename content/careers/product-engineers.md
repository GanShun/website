We are looking for engineers who love nice design and 
designers who love to code. We think the best teams are made up of both 
engineers and designers who take interest in each others
work and take the opportunity to learn from each other. We are looking for
the rare breed of folks with an eye for detail that also understand
infrastructure. If you have a love for developer tooling and making the lives
of operators easier through user experience, please apply!

We are looking for engineers and designers with a sharp attention to detail,
who love building products that delight operators and developers. This is a
rare opportunity to design and implement a new interface for developing 
cloud-like applications with a great team. We're seeking highly motivated folks 
that understand the application deployment process from the viewpoint of both 
the developer and operator.

This job will require taking complex ideas and making them simple for a user to
understand and use intuitively. We love folks with a passion for making the
impossible possible. We will be working directly with customers to provide
solutions for their needs. You will be working primarily on the user facing
interfaces, such as the API and management dashboard.

We are building in a space where users have been largely neglected so this is
a fun opportunity with a lot of impact to be had on user experience!

We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, 
tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. 
And while experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest 
can outweigh experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to 
step up. Oxide is based in Oakland, California, but remote work is possible for
folks with a track record of working effectively remotely.

### Requirements

- Front-end experience (CSS and JavaScript)
- Some backend experience in a framework of your choice
- Understanding of cloud technologies/infrastructure
- A sense of design taste for building intuitive interfaces
- Attention to detail for building user experiences that are awesome to use


### Nice to have

- Photoshop skills
- Experience with design systems and tools like Figma
