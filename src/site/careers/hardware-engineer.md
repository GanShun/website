Oxide is seeking hardware engineers to join us in building the next
generation of rack-scale, fully-integrated machines.  

<!--more-->

As a hardware engineer working at Oxide, you will:

- **Be involved in all aspects of server and/or switch design,** including
  mechanical, thermal, signal integrity, electrical

- **Work with software engineers** to co-design a system, finding ways
  to solve problems by making software and hardware cooperate rather than
  operate at cross-purposes

- **Lead a joint design manufacturer** to assist in the design and 
  manufacturing of our first product

These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we
don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do -- we can help you grow
wherever your interests take you.

You will thrive in this role if you:

- Get excited by the prospect of hardware/software co-design -- and
  especially at innovating at their interface.
- Have domain expertise (electrical, mechanical, etc.) but enjoy
  cross-disciplinary work with a broad team.
- Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
- Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
- Like working from first principles, wanting to really understand
  reference designs rather than blindly copy them.
- Get excited about a wide range of technical topics and dig really deep into
  them.
- Are very comfortable at a Unix terminal (but also know when to spin
  up a Windows VM to run necessary EDA tools!).
- Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front
  panels.

### Life at Oxide

We are very explicit about <a href="/about">our values</a>, and they can
be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:

- Our **rigor** means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
- Our **urgency** means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
- Our **versatility** is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of
  our team.
- Our **transparency** can be seen in our consensus-driven
  <a href="/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion/">RFD process</a>.
- Our **responsibility** means that we both lead and follow:  we have our own
  domains, but we also help others on their parts.
- Our **curiosity** shows in our insatiable desire to learn -- and our
  **empathy** in our love of teaching others.
- Our **humor** is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate
  wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.

Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:

- <a href="/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">Everyone
  makes $180,250, regardless of location.</a>
- We offer the best health insurance we could find:
  medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees
  *and* dependents.
- We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of
  the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a
  significant overlap with Pacific Time.
- Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us;
  our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that.
