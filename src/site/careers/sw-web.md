The web console is the last mile of Oxide’s vision: delivering the complexities of cloud infrastructure with a beautiful and functional interface that delights our customers.

<!--more-->

As a software engineer working on the web console, you will:

- **Work with engineers and designers** to understand customer use cases and define and implement the web interface to the Oxide platform.
- **Build a React app** that feels as fast and simple as a CLI.
- **Write code mostly in TypeScript**, read TypeScript and a bit of Rust. Rust experience is not required, but interest goes a long way.
- **Participate in usability testing** to refine the product.
- **Write tooling** to help you and other developers move faster.
- **Learn about all layers of the stack** exposed to users through the web console: fault-tolerant distributed systems and databases that support virtual machines, network-based virtual storage devices, and virtual networks.
- [**Code without fear**](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/12/21/fear-makes-you-a-worse-programmer/), supported by continuous builds, tests, a constructive code-review process, and a supportive culture of identifying and fixing bugs. Learn about and contribute to other non-web areas of the product that interest you.

These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do — we can help you grow wherever your interests take you.

You will thrive in this role if you:

- Are an experienced, [product-minded](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) software generalist with a frontend focus.
- Know web tech like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Are excited about accessibility.
- Have worked on single-page apps, but see [beyond](https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html) the frameworks of the day.
- Can debug backends when they’re not doing what you expect.
- Are interested in TypeScript and other typed languages. Experience is helpful but not required.
- Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
- Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
- Get excited about a wide range of technical topics and dig really deep into them.
- Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front panels.

If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously consider applying! We all come from different backgrounds with different skills.

### Life at Oxide

We are very explicit about <a href="/about">our values</a>, and they can
be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:

- Our **rigor** means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
- Our **urgency** means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
- Our **versatility** is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of
  our team.
- Our **transparency** can be seen in our consensus-driven
  <a href="/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion/">RFD process</a>.
- Our **responsibility** means that we both lead and follow:  we have our own
  domains, but we also help others on their parts.
- Our **curiosity** shows in our insatiable desire to learn -- and our
  **empathy** in our love of teaching others.
- Our **humor** is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate
  wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.

Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:

- <a href="/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">Everyone
  makes $180,250, regardless of location.</a>
- We offer the best health insurance we could find:
  medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees
  *and* dependents.
- We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of
  the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a
  significant overlap with Pacific Time.
- Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us;
  our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that.
