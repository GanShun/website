The control plane is the spinal column of Oxide's software: it is
responsible for managing and provisioning virtual machines, storage
and networking.

<!--more-->

As a software engineer working on the control plane, you will:

- **Collaborate with other engaged, friendly, systems-oriented engineers** to
  understand customer use cases and implement the core of the Oxide platform.

- **Operate across multiple layers of the stack** to build the fault-tolerant
  distributed systems and databases that support virtual machines,
  network-based virtual storage devices, and virtual networks.

- **Drive our device security** by extending the verified boot chain from
  early boot to all the software running on Oxide systems. You’ll secure the
  interface to the control plane, build identity and access control, and work
  with the team to define and defend against threats.

- **Develop tools to test and analyze complex systems,** including those
  deployed in production at customer sites. Logging, tracing, and metrics are
  critical pieces of distributed systems, and you’ll get the chance to dig
  into them all.

- **Write code mostly in Rust, read code primarily written in Rust and C.**
  The vast majority of code you write will be open source (maybe all of
  it!), across many different codebases.

  without fear,**</a>
  working
  with the team to create and maintain continuous builds, tests, memory-safe
  code, debugging tools, a constructive code-review process, and a supportive
  culture of identifying and fixing bugs.  Contribute to other, non-control
  plane areas of the product that interest you.

These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we
don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do -- we can help you grow
wherever your interests take you.

You will thrive in this role if you:

- Have previously worked with Rust or another low-level systems language such
  as C.
- Are energized by the thought of jumping between handling multi-machine fault
  tolerance, analyzing storage latency patterns, and bringing kernel drivers
  to life.
- Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
- Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
- Get excited about a wide range of technical topics and dig really deep into
  them.
- Are very comfortable at a Unix terminal.
- Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front
  panels.

If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously
consider applying -- at least one of us was missing each of these at the
outset!

### Life at Oxide

We are very explicit about <a href="/about">our values</a>, and they can
be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:

- Our **rigor** means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
- Our **urgency** means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
- Our **versatility** is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of
  our team.
- Our **transparency** can be seen in our consensus-driven
  <a href="/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion/">RFD process</a>.
- Our **responsibility** means that we both lead and follow:  we have our own
  domains, but we also help others on their parts.
- Our **curiosity** shows in our insatiable desire to learn -- and our
  **empathy** in our love of teaching others.
- Our **humor** is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate
  wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.

Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:

- <a href="/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">Everyone
  makes $180,250, regardless of location.</a>
- We offer the best health insurance we could find:
  medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees
  *and* dependents.
- We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of
  the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a
  significant overlap with Pacific Time.
- Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us;
  our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that.
