The rack-scale computer is loaded with essential embedded systems,
responsible for the many unseen components that support the operation of
a rack-scale computer.

<!--more-->

As a software engineer working on embedded systems software, you will:

- **Work with a friendly and positive team** to write the low-level code that
  makes Oxide computers tick.

- **Write code mostly in Rust, read code primarily written in Rust and C.**
  The vast majority of code you write will be open source (maybe all of it!),
  and we are not starting with existing vendor code -- we’re trying to do
  things right.

- **Write programs that interact with the physical world,** from blinking
  lights to rack-level thermal control systems to supporting hot-swap of
  server components.

- **Read datasheets for relevant sensors, microcontrollers, etc.,** and
   implement drivers for them in bare-metal and embedded RTOS environments.

- **Drive our device security** by extending the verified boot chain from
  first instruction to the control plane running on Oxide systems. You’ll
  secure the interface among lowest level components and into the control
  plane, build identity and access control, and work with the team to define
  and defend against threats.

- <a href="

  without fear,**</a> supported by continuous builds, unit testing,
  memory-safe code, good debugging tools, a constructive code-review process,
  and a supportive culture of identifying and fixing bugs.

These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we
don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do -- we can help you grow
wherever your interests take you.

You will thrive in this role if you:

- Have previously worked with Rust or another low-level systems language such
  as C.
- Have worked with microcontrollers, whether it’s at a job or some kind of
  Arduino pet-washing coffee maker.
- Believe in fully documenting your ideas.
- Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others.
- Get excited about things and dig really deep into them.
- Are very comfortable at a Unix terminal.
- Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front
  panels.

If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously
consider applying -- at least one of us was missing each of these at the
outset!

### Life at Oxide

We are very explicit about <a href="/about">our values</a>, and they can
be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:

- Our **rigor** means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering.
- Our **urgency** means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
- Our **versatility** is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of
  our team.
- Our **transparency** can be seen in our consensus-driven
  <a href="/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion/">RFD process</a>.
- Our **responsibility** means that we both lead and follow:  we have our own
  domains, but we also help others on their parts.
- Our **curiosity** shows in our insatiable desire to learn -- and our
  **empathy** in our love of teaching others.
- Our **humor** is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate
  wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.

Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:

- <a href="/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">Everyone
  makes $180,250, regardless of location.</a>
- We offer the best health insurance we could find:
  medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees
  *and* dependents.
- We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of
  the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a
  significant overlap with Pacific Time.
- Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us;
  our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that.
