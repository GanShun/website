Oxide is seeking a user interface engineer to help us build our rack-scale computer.  

<!--more-->

Oxide is a different kind of company: to our marrow, we believe that the best products result from designing software with hardware.  As a user interface engineer, you represent the important last mile of that vision:  delivering the complexities of cloud infrastructure with a beautiful and functional interface that delights our customers.  You have likely spent much of your career developing data-rich browser-based interfaces and, while versed in modern frameworks (and likely being opinionated about them), you are enough of a veteran to see beyond the framework of the day.

You have both a strong engineering sense and a strong design sense (and you may have called yourself either or both over the course of your career), but you especially value collaboration with those who call themselves one or the other: you know that our best work represents a confluence of technical and aesthetic sensibilities.  In any other company, you might call yourself "full-stack" -- but in a company that includes engineers writing everything from the lowest layers of firmware through hypervisors, a control plane, and API endpoints, you know that full-stack takes on an entirely new dimension. Indeed, you find yourself excited by this dimension rather than terrified by it:  you are enough of a generalist to appreciate the challenges of hardware and of elastic infrastructure, but also sufficiently specialized to know how your expertise can play a uniquely important role in providing a superlative product to our customers.

Oxide is based in Emeryville, California, but we support remote work as well.
