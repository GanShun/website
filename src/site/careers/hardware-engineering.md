Oxide is seeking hardware engineers to join us in building the next generation of rack-scale fully-integrated machines.  

<!--more-->

You should have server design experience in every stage of development: ODM/JDM selection, PRD development, EVT/DVT/PVT, and deployment into production.  You should have experience working with firmware (host firmware, BMC, etc.), and interest in the software stack on the host and beyond: the idea of working together with a bunch of software engineers who appreciate thoughtful hardware and want to integrate it into a complete system should be particularly appealing.  You take pride in a correct system, and you like to push systems to the breaking point; you have developed software to validate hardware -- and likely have used it to isolate and debug some nasty hardware bugs.  You may have some
interest or experience in tamper-resistant systems and hardware roots of trust, knowing that current server designs are woefully behind the state of the art.  You probably have experience or interest in the Open Compute Project, and you are motivated by the idea of your designs having the broadest possible impact.  

Oxide is based in Emeryville, California. While we are open to remote work, we believe that will be difficult for this role.
