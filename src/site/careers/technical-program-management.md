Oxide is seeking a technical program manager for the development and delivery of our first product: a rack-scale computer.  

<!--more-->

This product is vast and complicated (we joke on the team that Oxide is actually nine different startups!) – board/rack design, networking, compute, storage, firmware, system software, control plane, API endpoints, operator consoles, etc.  There is a lot to get right, and this role is about attending to those details.  You will work with our design and manufacturing partners (and their supply chains), our product designers, our customer design council, and (of course!) our engineers to assure that we together deliver a product that our customers love and we can all be proud of. 

We are industry veterans, and presumably so are you.  Each of us has had the privilege of working with someone with your unusual combination of skills: you are energetic, detail-oriented, and responsive -- but that doesn't capture all of it.  On the programs and projects that you have worked on, your teammates describe you as essential -- the person who always knew what was slipping through the cracks or who needed to talk to whom.  When things fell behind or went wrong, you were the one making sure the right person or team or partner was on it – and you have thrived in environments that valued problem-solving over finger-pointing.  In terms of Oxide's values, you will likely see yourself particularly reflected in our values of responsibility, teamwork, versatility, optimism, curiosity, and humor (even if the humor is a bit dark when it's all going sideways!).  We are open-minded about backgrounds:  one of the things that our careers have taught is that people who are particularly good at this role often themselves have varied careers – and it wouldn't be at all surprising to us if your background is in a different domain. 

Oxide is based in Emeryville, California, but we believe that this role can be effective remotely, especially for one who has remote experience.
