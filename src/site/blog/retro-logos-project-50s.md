Happy Friday!! As a wrap to this week we are now in the 50s! 
Let's jump into some of the innovations from this decade: 


Be sure to 
share your favorite moments from the 50s with us 
[@oxidecomputer](https://twitter.com/oxidecomputer)!


For this decade, we have two logos! We couldn't decide on just one so we went
with two! Can you guess the inspiration for both of these?

</div>

Huge thank you to [Lizzo](LINK TO SOMETHING) for creating all these amazing logo
designs! 

Thanks for going back in time with us this week! Have a great weekend everyone!
