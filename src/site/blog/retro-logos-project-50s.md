  Continuing our retro logos project and going through the 50s with some fun
  computer history.

Happy Friday!! As a wrap to this week we are now in the 50s! 
Let's jump into some of the innovations from this decade: 

- 1950: Magnetic drum memory is developed for the US Navy.
- 1951: The first Univac 1 is delivered to the US Census Bureau. Univac
    introduced the UNISERVO tape drive for the Univac 1. It was the first tape
    storage for a commercial computer. Alan Turning created the Turing Test.
- 1952: On November 4th, the Univac computer predicted the outcome of the
    election.
- 1953: Whirlwind core memory is developed at MIT. It was the first computer to
    use magnetic core memory.
- 1954: IBM introduced the 650 magnetic drum calculator.
- 1956: The first implementations of keyboards are developed at MIT. An early
    experiment was named a Flexowriter. IBM shipped the RAMRAC computer with
    magnetic disk storage.
- 1957: DEC was founded. FORTRAN is developed at IBM. 
- 1958: LISP is invented by John McCarthy at MIT.

For this decade, we have two logos! We couldn't decide on just one so we went
with two! Can you guess the inspiration for both of these?

It was a pleasure to work with [Lizzo Ponzielli](https://www.instagram.com/lizzoart/) 
on all these amazing retro Oxide logos! 

Thanks for going back in time with us this week! It was a ton of fun to imagine 
what our logo would have looked like in the past. We sure have come a long way
from the 1950s. I cannot wait to see what innovations lie ahead for the next 50
years! The future of computer history has yet to be written.
