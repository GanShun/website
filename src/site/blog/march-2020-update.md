Hello friends!

I want to start by saying we wish you the very best during this unprecedented time
in which we are all united. 
Our thoughts go out to everyone working hard to help those in need. 
We wish you and your families health and resilience.

### Hard at work... and growing

A lot has happened at Oxide since we first de-cloaked in December and I apologize 
for the lack of an official update on our end, other than our Twitter feeds. We've
been hard at work building a product!

We are now a [team](/team) of 15 people! 
Everyone was in Emeryville for the 
Open Compute Summit, which was cancelled, but we still made the best of it by 
having company-wide face-to-face architecture discussions. We even snapped a 
photo with the whole team. As Bryan 
[said](https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1237463119581949953): we cannot 
wait for this image to be burned into a ROM.

### Computer History Museum

We also made sure to visit the Computer History Museum while everyone
was in town. It was fun to have some folks from the open firmware community
join us as well! Since it was not busy we got to spend an unusually long amount 
of time with the docent at the IBM 1401 demo which was fascinating.

### On the Metal

Last month, we wrapped up the first season of our podcast, 
[On the Metal](https://oxide.computer/podcast/). These were super fun to 
record and I know we are looking forward to Season 2 just as much as you are!

### PCI

On February 18th, we received the most perfect PCI vendor ID: `01DE`. 
Huge thanks to [Robert Mustacchi](https://twitter.com/rmustacc) for getting that!

### Moving in

[Cliff L. Biffle](http://cliffle.com/) made us new signs for our conference rooms!

We have gotten some amazing mugs from folks for our collection, thank you all

### The phone lines are now open!

Last Monday, I [opened our phone line](https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/1239584753205923841) 
to anyone who wanted to share stories about their hardware pain. Thank you to everyone for 
the wonderful conversations!

### oxide.computer v2

On Wednesday, [Jared Volpe](https://twitter.com/plainspace) 
shipped the redesign of this website! Pro tip: check out the 404 page ;) 

### Bryan at Oxidize 1K

On Friday, Bryan gave a talk on at 
[Oxidize 1K](https://oxidizeconf.com/oxidize-1k/) on 
"Tockilator: Deducing Tock execution flow

We will update this post once the video becomes available! For a good synopsis

### Stay tuned!

That's all for now. We will continue to update you with news as we go about building.
