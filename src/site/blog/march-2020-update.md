Hello friends!

Things have been moving very fast here and we apologize for the lack of an 
official update on our end, other than our Twitter feeds.

We are now a [team](/team) of 15 people! Everyone was in Emeryville for the 
Open Compute Summit, which was cancelled, but we still made the best of it by 
having company-wide face-to-face architecture discussions. We even snapped a 
photo with the whole team. As Bryan 
[said](https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1237463119581949953): we cannot 
wait for this image to be burned into a ROM.

We also made sure to visit the Computer History Museum while everyone
was in town. It was fun to have some folks from the open firmware community
join us as well! Since it was not busy we got to spend an unusually long amount 
of time with the docent at the IBM 1401 demo which was fascinating.

Last month, we wrapped up the first season of our podcast, 
[On the Metal](https://oxide.computer/podcast/). These were super fun to 
record and I know we are looking forward to Season 2 just as much as you are!

On February 18th, we received the most perfect PCI vendor ID: `01DE`! 
Huge thanks to [Robert Mustacchi](https://twitter.com/rmustacc) for getting that!

Bryan gave a talk at Stanford on [The Soul of a New Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc).
