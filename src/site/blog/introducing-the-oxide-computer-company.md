description: Introducing Oxide Computer Company
---

We have started a computer company!  If you haven't yet, read Jess's account of us being <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/born-in-a-garage/">born in a garage</a> and Bryan's on <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/?p=1086">the soul of our new computer company</a>.

Also, see the perspectives of some of our founding engineers: <a href="https://twitter.com/rmustacc">Robert Mustacchi</a> on <a href="https://fingolfin.org/blog/20191202/oxide.html">joining Oxide</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jmclulow">Joshua Clulow</a> on the need for <a href="https://sysmgr.org/blog/2019/12/02/a-new-machine/">a new machine</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/pfmooney">Patrick Mooney</a> on <a href="https://www.pfmooney.com/post/2019-12-02-the-new-thing/">everything he sees aligning at Oxide</a> (and in particular, on the importance of <a href="https://oxide.computer/principles">Oxide's principles</a>!).

If it needs to be said, starting a computer company is an ambitious endeavor; we are thrilled to have investment led by Eclipse Ventures and joined by an incredible group of institutional and angel investors.  Our investors see what we see:  the potential to integrate hardware and software together to bring hyperscaler-class infrastructure to everyone.

To use the machine as metaphor, Oxide is at the earliest stages of boot: the power is on, and the first instructions have been executed -- but we have a long way to go before we're fully operational!
