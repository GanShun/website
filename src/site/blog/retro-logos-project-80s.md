  computer history.

Welcome back!

As promised today we will be going back in time another decade to the 80s! The
80s had some great designs for computers and lots of innovations! These
are a few moments from computer history in the 80s:

- 1980: The Sinclair ZX80 was introduced in the UK as a small home computer. It
    originally sold for only £79 as a kit or £99 pre-assembled.
- 1981: Sony introduced the first 3 ½-inch floppy drives and diskettes. IBM
    introduced their personal computer, the IBM Model 5150, which went hand in
    hand with an MS-DOS release. The Osborne 1 was introduced, weighing 24
    pounds and at a price of $1,795.
- 1982: TIME magazine publishes "Machine of the Year" versus the usual "Man of
    the Year". Sun Microsystems was founded, the namesake from SUN was
    Stanford University Network. Commodore introduced the Commodore 64 which
    sold for $595 and came with 64 KB of RAM.
- 1983: Apple introduced the Lisa, which was the first commercial personal
    computer with a graphical user interface. Microsoft introduced Word.
- 1984: Apple launches the Macintosh with the infamous 1984 ad. Flash memory is
    invented by Fujio Masuoka. Matlab is released. Verilog, the hardware
    description language is created by Phil Moorby and Prabhu Goel.
- 1985: C++, the programming language, is published. Nintendo released the
    Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). 
- 1986: The SCSI-1 standard, the interface for connecting external devices 
    such as hard drives to computers, is adopted.
- 1987: IBM introduced their Personal System/2 (PS/2) machines, which included
    Intel's 80386 chip. Larry Wall wrote Perl.
- 1988: The NeXT cube is announced by Steve Jobs. The base model sold for
    $6,500. Stephen Wolfram created Mathematica.
- 1989: Nintendo released the Game Boy handheld gaming console.

It's fun to see how many innovations from the 80s still exist today, like
Mathematica, Word, Verilog, and more.
This doesn't include _every_ awesome innovation from this decade. Be sure to s

For this decade, we have not one but two awesome logos. You should be able to
guess what inspired each logo! Hint: they are mentioned above!
