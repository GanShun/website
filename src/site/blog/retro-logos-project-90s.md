  Introducing the retro logos project and going through the 90s with some fun
  computer history.
---

ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

When we originally were deciding on the logo for the company, the designer
working on it returned us an amazing logo that looked so awesomely 80s that of
course I fell in love with it. Ultimately, it was not the logo we decided to use
for the company but it did inspire creating a collection of logos encompassing
the design style of each era. Over the next few days we will unveil the logo 
for an era, starting today with the 90s! 

The 90s were a great time for personal computers and innovation. Let's go over
some of the innovations in computing that happened in the 90s. By no means is
this list exhaustive, it is merely a reference to some of my favorite moments in
history. 

- 1990: The world wide web was released out of CERN, thank you Tim Berners-Lee!
    Originally it only ran on NeXT computers!
- 1991: Apple's PowerBook laptops, with built in trackball, are released.
- 1993: Windows NT is released.
-  1994: Zip drives are released from Iomega, allowing 100MB to be stored on
    a single Zip Disk.
- 1995 and later: The big browser war between Netscape and Microsoft.
- 1997: The CD-RW is introduced.
- 1998: The colorful iMacs are launched.

Please share with us, [@oxidecomputer](https://twitter.com/oxidecomputer),
your favorite memories from the 90s we didn't mention!

The logo we came up for this era should be easy to pin point exactly what
inspired it :) but we will let you all guess for yourselves!
