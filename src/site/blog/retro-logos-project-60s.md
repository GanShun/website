    DEC PDP-1 is introduced. It cost about $120,000.

    Communications of the ACM. The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) is debuted.
    The IBM "Minnow" floppy disk drive, which was the floppy disk drive, began
    development. [The mother of all demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY)
    takes place in San Francisco.

The inspiration for this logo is very near and dear to my heart since I have a
