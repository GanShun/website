  On this episode of On the Metal, we interview John Graham-Cumming. Some folks
  might know John as the CTO of Cloudflare, but he is also a great source of
  knowledge about computer history including Turing, Babbage, and Lovelace. 
  Join us as we step back in time and learn
  about how John got started in computers, hacking his school's network to make
  his own network faster, and all sorts of details of
  computing history.

We are back! Because of the pandemic we have not recorded any more episodes of
On the Metal. We did, however, have three episodes recorded for season 2 early
last year. Since they were starting to suffer from bit rot, we thought we should
share them with you all. You can consider us opening up the vault to bring
you three special, better-late-than-never episodes! Enjoy!
