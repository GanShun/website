Welcome back to the second of our three part bonus season of On the Metal:
episodes that we recorded after the end of Season 1 but before the onset of the
pandemic.

On this episode of On the Metal, we interview Star Simpson, autonomous
aviation visionary, insatiably curious engineer, and relentless optimizer.
Join us as we learn how a pirated C++ compiler at an impressionable age pushed
Star towards electronics, how a friend jockeying for Hacker News karma landed
her work on late-night TV -- and why you definitely didn't want to be test
pilot on the Piasecki PA-97.  And if you find yourself hankering for a good
read, you're in luck: this episode ends with a flurry of book recommendations
sure to sate your inner aviation buff.
