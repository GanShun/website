    Welcome to our new podcast, On the Metal! As a part of starting a company, 
    we decided to also create the podcast we always wanted. 
    It's unapologetically technical and as Jess says, 'the nerdiest podcast 
    on the face of the planet.' Join us as we interview various guests from 
    the hardware / software interface. Their stories have mystified us all 
    and kept us wanting more, we can't wait to share them with you! Stay tuned!
